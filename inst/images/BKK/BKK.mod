/*
 * This file implements the multi-country RBC model with time to build,
 * described in Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1992): "International Real Business
 * Cycles", Journal of Political Economy, 100(4), 745-775.
 *
 * The notation for the variable names are the same in this file than in the paper.
 * However the timing convention is different: we had to taken into account the
 * fact that in Dynare, if a variable is denoted at the current period, then
 * this variable must be also decided at the current period.
 * Concretely, here are the differences between the paper and the model file:
 * - z_t in the model file is equal to z_{t+1} in the paper
 * - k_t in the model file is equal to k_{t+J} in the paper
 * - s_t in the model file is equal to s_{J,t}=s_{J-1,t+1}=...=s_{1,t+J-1} in the paper
 *
 * The macroprocessor is used in this file to create a loop over countries.
 * Only two countries are used here (as in the paper), but it is easy to add
 * new countries in the corresponding macro-variable and completing the
 * calibration.
 *
 * The calibration is the same than in the paper. The results in terms of
 * moments of variables are very close to that of the paper (but not equal
 * since the authors a different solution method).
 *
 * This implementation was written by Sebastien Villemot. Please note that the
 * following copyright notice only applies to this Dynare implementation of the
 * model.
