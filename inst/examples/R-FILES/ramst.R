 * An elementary RBC model, simulated in a deterministic setup.
 *
 * The model is the following: this is a closed economy, with a representative
 * agent. The utility is equal to 'c^(1-gam)/(1-gam)', where 'c' is consumption
 * and 'gam' is relative risk aversion. The subjective discount is 'bet'.
 *
 * The production function equals 'aa*x*k(-1)^alph', where 'aa' is a constant,
 * 'x' is a stochastic technology level variable, 'k' is capital (using
 * end-of-period timing convention, which is Dynare's default), and 'alph' is
* another constant.
*
  * Capital stock evolves according to the usual law of motion, where 'delt'
* is the depreciation rate.
